May 2020 LeetCoding Challenge

Problems appear at midnight, Pacific Daylight Time.
You'll have one day to correctly solve each problem
for 10 LeetCoins. After that, you can still solve it,
however, you won't get any LeetCoins. A new problem
will appear each day.

There are 5 weeks in May 2020.
The challenge provides seven puzzles for every week 1 to 4,
but only 3 for week 5. This gives one for every day of May.
