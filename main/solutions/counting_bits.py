Week 4, Day 7: Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num
calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

    Input: 2
    Output: [0,1,1]

Example 2:

    Input: 5
    Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

Follow up:

    It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can
    you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?

    Space complexity should be O(n).

    Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount
    in c++ or in any other language.

Hints:

    You should make use of what you have produced already.

    Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new
    range from previous.

    Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
